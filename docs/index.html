    <p>These timelines are <span>red</span>, <span>green</span> and <span>blue</span>. They are the 3 timelines that you are trying to merge together to fix your timeline. The timelines are not the same, they are different timelines. They are not the same as the timeline that you are currently on. They are different timelines.</p> -->
